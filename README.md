# YouTube to MP3 (320kbps + thumbnail)
So made this to get a hands-on on making a working app in Python. Referred some online </br>
materials and a bit of help from "other sources".</br>
</t>
The audio file downloaded is in 320kbps format (highest quality) and the thumbnail is embedded to it for </br>
better pre-viewing experience (like in Windows Media Player or VLC, we can see the thumbnail instead of the default music icon)

Start by > pip install -r requirements.txt </br>
Refer build.txt for building the app (.exe file) in your 'dist' folder.
